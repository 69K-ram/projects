The ROM_DUMP sketch can be used with probably all parallel EPROM/EEPROM/FLASH chips, just change the pin numbers.

Also, I included the ROM dumps I got from the Typestar 6. I have 3 copies in case one time there was an error reading. 
The fastread file should be good as I had a 1ms delay between reads, and the chip says it's good for 250ns.
